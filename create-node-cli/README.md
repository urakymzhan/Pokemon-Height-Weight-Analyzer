# Intro

Using 3rd party Pokemon API, write average height and weight of pokemon to the console.

This solution uses npm packege [create-node-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-node-cli)

# Commands

I didn't package our `pokemon` CLI as a single executable

Run

-   `npm run dev`

# Language

-   Node
-   JavaScript

# Test

-   I wish i had more time to write a good test case CLI
-   Currently simply testing what is being logged
