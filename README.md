3 Solutions

- [shebang js](./javascript/)
- [shebang ts](./typescript/)
- [create-node-cli](./create-node-cli/)

## Notes

- Very interesting challenge.
- Never done something like before.
- I wish i had some more time to work on it.

--

- TypeScript solution might have more issues since i have less experience with it
- Tried to go with CLI solution instead of GUI (GUI would be easier for me)
- Test cases are not fully implemented
